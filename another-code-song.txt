(Verse 1)
Yo, listen up, I'm on my code hustle, breaking barriers down,
From the blocks to the screens, in every tech town.
Syntax so clean, yeah, I'm in my prime,
Spitting lines of code like it's my rhyme.

(Chorus)
Code hustle, that's how we roll,
From the keyboard to the console.
Lines of code, yeah, we stack 'em high,
In the coding game, we aim for the sky.

(Verse 2)
I'm a digital poet, with algorithms in my flow,
From Python to JavaScript, watch me glow.
Debugging all night, till the bugs are gone,
In the realm of bytes, I belong.

(Chorus)
Code hustle, that's how we roll,
From the keyboard to the console.
Lines of code, yeah, we stack 'em high,
In the coding game, we aim for the sky.

(Bridge)
I'm a code architect, building dreams with my hands,
In the world of scripts and commands.
From the binary beats to the ASCII streets,
In the coding world, we take feats.

(Verse 3)
I'm on a mission, rewriting the code,
With my tech flow, watch me explode.
From assembly to Java, I'm fluent in the tongue,
In the coding game, I've just begun.

(Chorus)
Code hustle, that's how we roll,
From the keyboard to the console.
Lines of code, yeah, we stack 'em high,
In the coding game, we aim for the sky.
